;; the multimap is for bookkeeping/reference only; the type-lookup function is derived from it at
;; construction time, and is always used instead because it is much faster. type-lookup is a
;; function taking a node-id and returning (if the node's type is valid as a from-edge on this
;; layer) another function. That function takes in a node-id and returns truthy iff it is a valid
;; destination node for an edge from the first node-id.
